            <p>
                I am a software developer from Austin, Texas, with a solid educational background and diverse technical expertise. 
                I earned my <u>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</u> from Southern New Hampshire University in 2024, and an <u>Associate's degree in Computer Science</u> from Austin Community College in 2021. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2023, I have been working as a Technical Support Advisor for Apple via KellyConnect.
                Outside of my professional life, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies, which include music, coding, exploring nature, and reading.

                <img src="assets/game-of-life.png" alt="Game of Life">
                <p>
                    An interactive Python implementation of the cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. 
                    A cellular automaton is a discrete model composed of a grid of cells, each of which can be in a finite number of states and evolves according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. 
                    Users can play, pause, clear, reset, and randomize the grid while exploring the evolution of these emerging patterns.
                    This program also features simulation statistics and adjustable speed controls.

                <img src="assets/melody-grid.png" alt="Melody Grid">
                <p>
                    An interactive web-based music grid that enables users to create and play melodies and chords. 
                    The grid consists of an 8x8 matrix where each cell represents a different pitch within a selected scale. 
                    Tapping on a bubble highlights it, and highlighted cells are played when the play button is pressed.
                    Users can also adjust playback tempo, select the tonic and scale, clear the grid, or even randomize the grid.
                    Works on both desktop and mobile platforms.

                <img src="assets/microbe-simulator.png" alt="Microbe Simulator">
                <p>
                    An interactive JavaScript simulation where users can drag and drop different types of microbes (predators, viruses, prey, reproducers) to observe their unique behaviors and interactions. 
                    Predators hunt other microbes, viruses infect prey and reproducers, prey move randomly, and reproducers multiply under specific conditions. 
                    The code includes collision detection, lifespan management, and real-time updates on microbe statistics.

                <p>
                    A website built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that generates random abstract geometric art. 
                    It creates various shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, lines, and rings, each with random sizes, colors, positions, and rotations. 
                    Users can save their creations as PNG images.

                    A JavaScript and HTML project that transforms user-input text into poetry by selectively highlighting words. 
                    Users can input paragraphs of text, which the application converts into visually distinct passages or phrases. 
                    Additionally, the project includes functionality to save the transformed text as a .txt file, facilitating easy sharing.
